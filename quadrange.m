function removal = quadrange( OptimalSpeed, PowerRequired )
% QUADRANGE 
%     quadrange( OptimalSpeed, Endurance ) is a function to seek the
%     maximum range for a quadrotor. The main algorithm is using optimal
%     forward speed, it also means the minimum power required speed speed. 
%     We using the speed and endurance to figure out the maximum range. The
%     unit of range in kilometer.
