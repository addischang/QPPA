% QUADENDURANCE
%     endurance( MinimunPower, BatNumber, BatCapity ) is a
%     function to figure out the maximun endurance for the quadrotor while
%     in pure forward flight. Notice that, the endurance is couple with the
%     number of batteries and capibility of batteries. The unit of
%     endurance is in hour.
